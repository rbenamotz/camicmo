# camicmo
Camera and Microphone Monitor

Camicmo will run in the background (taking almost zero CPI and memory) and will monitor when applications activly use Microphone or Camera.

Once that happens, camicmo will send notification to physical device (soon....) and / or MQTT server.

This allows easy integration with home automation systems.

## Sample usage

* Light the room better once camera in use
* Add a watning light that camera is on
* Illuminate "quiet" sign outside the room while microphone is in use

## Privacy
Everything is local. System does not collet and personal infromation, does not store usage logs, and does not "call home".
